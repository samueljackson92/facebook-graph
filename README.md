Facebook Graph
==============

Makes a visual graph of your friends with edges representing mutual friends. Built using arbor.js, JQuery and Bootstrap.

###Configuration

This application needs to use the facebook graph API which requires oauth access. 
The application ID and application secret needs to be put inside a file called config.json. An
example config file is listed in the repository (config_TEMPLATE.json). Add your API data and rename it to config.json
and the application will work.
